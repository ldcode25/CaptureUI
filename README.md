- **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling for camera access issues.

## Installation

To install CaptureUI, you can use Swift Package Manager. Follow these steps:

1. Open your Xcode project.
2. Navigate to `File` > `Swift Packages` > `Add Package Dependency`.
3. Enter the following URL: `https://github.com/ldcode25/CaptureUI.git`.
4. Choose the version you want to install and complete the setup.

## Usage

To use CaptureUI in your SwiftUI application, follow these steps:

1. Import the library in your Swift file:

   ```swift
   import CaptureUI
   ```

2. Create a `CaptureView` instance in your SwiftUI view:

   ```swift
   struct ContentView: View {
       var body: some View {
           CaptureView()
               .frame(width: 300, height: 400)
       }
   }
   ```

3. Customize the view as needed by passing parameters to `CaptureView`.

## Customization

CaptureUI offers various customization options. You can adjust the following properties:

- **Camera Type**: Choose between front and back cameras.
- **Overlay View**: Add custom overlays like buttons or text.
- **Capture Button**: Change the appearance and size of the capture button.
- **Flash Mode**: Set the default flash mode (on, off, auto).

### Example of Customization

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to customize the `CaptureView`:

```swift
struct CustomCaptureView: View {
    var body: some View {
        CaptureView(cameraType: .back, overlay: CustomOverlay())
            .frame(width: 300, height: 400)
    }
}

struct CustomOverlay: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Spacer()
            Button(action: {
                // Capture action
            }) {
                Text("Capture")
                    .padding()
                    .background(Color.blue)
                    .foregroundColor(.white)
                    .cornerRadius(10)
            }
            .padding(.bottom, 20)
        }
    }
}
```
